 SplitMate – Smart Expense Splitting Made Simple
Sharing expenses shouldn’t feel like solving a math puzzle.
SplitMate is here to make it seamless, fair, and fun.

SplitMate is a web app that helps friends, roommates, and groups split shared expenses with ease — whether you're out for dinner, planning a trip, or managing rent. With clear tracking, real-time updates, and UPI-powered settlements, SplitMate ensures no one is left confused or unpaid.

💡 Idea
SplitMate is built for anyone who's ever:

Gone out with friends and lost track of who paid what

Found it awkward to remind people about what they owe

Struggled to calculate fair splits and repayments

Wanted a tool that works like Splitwise — but cleaner, simpler, and more localized (India-friendly)

SplitMate allows users to:

Create groups

Add shared expenses

Track who owes whom

Settle up with real UPI payment links (Paytm, PhonePe, etc.)

⚙️ MVP Features
🔹 Group Expense Tracking
Split expenses equally (or unequally), track them per group, and automatically calculate balances.

🔹 Real-Time Split Summary
Get a clean breakdown like:
Anjali owes Ravi ₹150,
Ravi owes Priya ₹200 — no manual calculations needed.

🔹 UPI Payment Integration
Generate smart UPI links to settle dues instantly via Paytm, PhonePe, Google Pay, etc.

🔹 Activity Feed
See what was added or settled — just like a group chat, but for expenses.
